== Making a contribution ==

Before you start working on a larger contribution you should get in touch with us first through the Page Speed [http://groups.google.com/group/page-speed-discuss discussion mailing list].

== Signing the license agreement ==

Before we can use your code you have to sign the [http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html Google Individual Contributor License Agreement], which you can do online.  This is mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code.  We also need to be sure of various other things, for instance that you'll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people's patents.  You don't have to do this until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has approved it, but you will have to do it before we can put your code into our codebase.

Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement from the one above, the [http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement].
