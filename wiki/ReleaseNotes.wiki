== 1.5  12/14/2009 ==
The largest change in this release is a change to use the Page Speed C++ Native Library.  This should speed up scoring, as well as allow rules to be run in programs other than just the Page Speed Firefox extension.  There will be some subtle differences in the scoring of rules between the old !JavaScript rules and the new library rules.  We are still working on evaluating the scoring mechanism as we port rules to C++ with the goal of making the scores more accurately reflect the value of fixing the issues that have been found.  Not all rules have been ported to C++ in this release.  In general, you will not be able to tell if a rule is run in JS or in C++.

Lots of thanks to Oksana Tkanko who has contributed code to this release.  We look forward to more code from Oksana and others in the open source community.

With this release we are dropping support for PPC-based Mac OS computers.

The following changes and bug fixes were made for the 1.5 release of Page Speed:
 * Switching between tabs should not re-run the analysis http://code.google.com/p/page-speed/issues/detail?id=22
 * Added avoid_bad_requests rule. (404s)  http://code.google.com/p/page-speed/issues/detail?id=164
 * Make the full results beacon automatically run when the proper prefs are set.  http://code.google.com/p/page-speed/issues/detail?id=122
 * Made temporary file names easier to read by removing the query string and non alpha-numeric characters.  http://code.google.com/p/page-speed/issues/detail?id=11
 * Fixed an alert that triggered when Firebug was closed while the activity panel was still recording.  http://code.google.com/p/page-speed/issues/detail?id=130

Changes that do not have issue numbers:
 * Ordered the array of lint rules in the JSON output by the short rule name so different runs can be compared using diff. 
 * Split image compression image scaling into 2 rules.
 * Updated the analysis results to show the overall score as xx/100.
 * Ported rules to C++ to increase the consistency between the Site Performance and Page Speed.
 * Enable compression rule now runs gzip on resource bodies to produce a more accurate savings estimate.
 * Dropped support for Mac PPC because the build system no longer supports it and fewer than 1% of Page Speed users are on this platform.
 * Updated latest supported version of Firebug to be 1.4.5
 * Enabled the export menu so that results can be published to http://www.showslow.com/ by default.  Added preferences so you can easily tweak them via the "about:config" URL.

== 1.4: 11/5/2009 ==

  * Use Closure Compiler in the "Minify JS" rule if the Closure Compiler Page Speed extension is installed.  This feature is currently only available under Windows and requires Sun Java VM 1.6 or later; support for other platforms is in the works.

== 1.3: 10/8/2009 ==

  * Added "Minify CSS" rule.
  * Added support for capturing Paint Snapshots as described in this article: http://code.google.com/speed/articles/browser-paint-events.html
  * Improvements to "Show Resources" panel including an indicator that shows which resources were served from the browser cache.
  * Add FB support through 1.4.3.

== 1.2: 8/20/2009 ==
  * Activity panel now shows paint events, which indicate time firefox spends drawing a page.
  * Add a menu which allows users to export results as JSON encoded text.
  * User agent list now shows only the most recent versions of browsers, unless "Show All User Agents" is checked in the options menu.
  * Add FB support through 1.4.2.


== 1.1: 7/22/2009 ==
  * Make the directory where optimized output is written a choice in the options menu.
  * Make CSS rule warning about :hover non-scoring.
  * Only warn about :hover if it is not applied to an anchor tag.
  * Fix link to documentation for the rule 'Serve resources from a consistent URL'.
  * Fix conflict with other firebug extensions, including SenSEO.
  * Unused CSS Rule now reads all CSS in a page.
  * Never change permissions on a directory unless Page Speed created it.
  * Better error messages in the activity panel.
  * Support JS events in the activity panel for both FF3.0 and FF3.5.
  * Update to activity panel to work with firebug 1.4.
  * Add a preference to enable full JS debugging on firefox 3.5. Â This crashes in firefox 3.5, so it is disabled by default.  The bug is tracked at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=505041 .


== 1.0.1.1: 6/23/2009 ==
  * Fix a spelling error in a menu item.

== 1.0.1.0: 6/23/2009 ==
  * Add support for Firefox 3.5`*`.
  * Add support for Firebug 1.4.
  * Optimized image and !JavaScript files are written to the temporary file area of the user's OS, instead of the user's home directory. 
    * On Linux, optimized files are saved to /tmp/ .
    * On the Mac OS, optimized files are saved to /Users/<user name>/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/
    * On Windows, optimized files are saved to C:\Documents and Settings\<user name>\Local Settings\Temp\
  * Rule names in Page Speed scorecard are now colored as normal links.
  * Fix CSS expression lint output to have working links to CSS source.
  * Add several links to documentation, including a help button and tool tip text on the rule names that makes it clear that they link to docs.
  * Make exceptions in rules report the file and line number. This will make diagnosing failures from bug reports much easier.

`*`Activity Panel is not fully functional in Firefox 3.5 (!JavaScript
events are missing). Defer Loading of !JavaScript is not functional in
Firefox 3.5/FB1.4. We will fix these issues in an upcoming release.

== 1.0.0: 6/4/2009 ==
 * Initial release.
